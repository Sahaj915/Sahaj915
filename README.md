### Data Analysis | Python | Frontend (HTML • CSS • JavaScript) | Data Structures and Algorithms


I’m a B.Tech Data Science student interested in working at the intersection of data and web development.  
I enjoy analyzing real-world data to find patterns and building clean, responsive user interfaces.


I believe in **learning by building real projects**, not just following tutorials.
